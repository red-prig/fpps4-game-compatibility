Anyone is free to update or share their results here, with the following requirements:

-   You  **must**  use an official master/main build with any hacks disabled. All mods & cheats of any kind must also be disabled.
-   Include the title ID in all caps in the title of the issue; i.e. issue name will be Disco Elysium: The Final Cut - CUSA26506 or you may see existing issues for examples.
-   Search for a game first before adding a new issue; if you find an existing issue that is out of date, reply to it.
- DO NOT create duplicate issues, common issues (i.e. Crashes in various games, Naughty Dogs games are not booting etc).
- If some game boots on earlier versions and does not boot (or some bugs was appeared) on newer - report last working version.
- When game is crashes - submit function name where it was happened, like `nop nid:libkernel:C8E7C683F2356482:scePthreadRwlockattrInit`
- When you update or add additional information in an issue, please reply to the issue indicating your changes.
- Point a game's version - some games behaviors differently after updates. So you can try to update your game with patches, just mentiion it if somethings changes.
- *Optionally*: submit `dump_sym.exe -i ebootname.bin -o sometextfile.txt` output here using details tag (it looks like spoiler), or use webservices like pastebin. You can compile dump_sym.exe by yourself.
What files **ALLOWED** to submit - screenshots, log files (if you have it).
What files are **RESTRICTED AND BANNED** - **ANY** copyrighted content like eboot.bin, sprx files, SDK leaked files, PKG files, homebrew applications made with official SDKs.

-   `status-ingame`  - Boots and goes in-game but suffers from one or more of the following: crashes, deadlocks, gpu bugs, bad audio, or is simply too slow. Game still might able to be played all the way through, but not as the game is intended to play.
